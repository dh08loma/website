      I would like to use NBA data from <a title="http://www.nbaminer.com/four-factors/" href="http://www.nbaminer.com/four-factors/" target="_blank">http://www.nbaminer.com/four-factors/</a> to visualize for my final project. I scraped this data myself for a side project, so there shouldn't be any licensing concerns. This data is all numeric, with the exception of team and year. I chose this dataset because I am working on a sports analytics blog, so it would be nice to have a cool visualization to post on it. I already did one project with this data but I believe there is more to tell. Creating a visualization can help extract information from this data that I wouldn't have seen otherwise, and then I'd be able to write about it.
